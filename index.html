                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>I grew up in southeast Michigan, but moved to Washington in high school and instantly fell in love with the Pacific Northwest. 
                I have always been passionate about technology (I vividly remember the day my family got Internet as one of the greatest days in history), but I wasn't initially confident in my ability to pursue it as a career. 
                I worked many years in retail management, where I honed my interpersonal and customer service skills to an expert level. 
                During this time, I earned my Associate in Arts. In 2017, I transitioned from brick and morter retail to e-commerce, where I worked with product designers on projects,
                and served as a web coordinator. It was during this time that my interest in tech was heightened and I made the decision to pursue it as a career.
                I earned my Bachelor of Information Technology, and obtained several professional certifications in the process. In 2021, I became a parent and
                took a career break to care for my daughter full time. I continue to practice and build my skills in my free time.
                <br><br>
                Other free time activities include yoga, video games, and Dungeons & Dragons (DM here!).
                <br><br>
                I am incredibly eager to learn and gain experience, and I can't wait to bring my unique blend of soft skills and technical knowledge to your table.
